# Python Algorithm Examples
by robotoART

### Objective
Present some fun and challenging Python algorithmic problems with solutions.

All code is written in **Python 2.7** unless noted otherwise. The code is in the [solutions.py file](https://github.com/robotoART/PythonAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/solutions.py) and the explanations of the algorithm are in the [explanations.txt file](https://github.com/robotoART/PythonAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/explanations.txt).

## Challenges

### 1) Search for an Anagram of a word inside another word
Given two strings s and t, determine whether some anagram of t is a substring
of s.

### 2) Hunting for the biggest palindrome inside a string
Given a string a, find the longest palindromic substring contained in a.

### 3) Minimum spanning tree(MST)
Given an undirected graph G, find the minimum spanning tree within G.

### 4) Find the least common ancestor between two nodes on a binary search tree(BST).
The least common ancestor(LCA) is the farthest node from the root that is an
ancestor of both nodes.

### 5) Get an element from the end of a singly linked list.
Counting from the end of the singly linked list, get the mth element.
